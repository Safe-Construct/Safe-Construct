## üìñ **Abstract**

Recognizing safety violations in construction environments is critical yet 
remains underexplored in computer vision. Existing models 
predominantly rely on 2D object detection, which fails to capture the 
complexities of real-world violations due to: (i) an oversimplified task 
formulation treating violation recognition merely as object detection, 
(ii) in-adequate validation under realistic conditions, (iii) absence of 
standardized baselines, and (iv) limited scalability from the 
unavailability of synthetic dataset generators for diverse construction 
scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce Safe-Construct, 
the first framework that reformulates violation recognition as a 3D 
multi-view engagement task, leveraging scene-level worker-object context 
and 3D spatial understanding. We also propose the Synthetic Indoor 
Construction Site Generator (SICSG) to create diverse, scalable training 
data, overcoming data limitations. Safe-Construct achieves a <strong>7.6%</strong> 
improvement over state-of-the-art methods across four violation types. We 
rigorously evaluate our approach in near-realistic settings, incorporating 
four violations, four workers, 14 objects, and challenging conditions like 
occlusions (worker-object, worker-worker) and variable illumination (back-lighting, 
overexposure, sunlight). By integrating 3D multi-view spatial understanding 
and synthetic data generation, Safe-Construct sets a new benchmark for 
scalable and robust safety monitoring in high-risk industries.
